# Hello, Hatter

Hatter is a fairly simple, indented, dynamic, imperative programming
language with native HTML tags, inspired by Imba.

It's more like a templating language than a real programming language.
If you already know how to code, you'll pick it up in no time.

Here's the view from up high:

- Indentation-based like Python, Nim, or CoffeeScript.

- Only a few simple types: `bool`, `int`, `float`, `string`, `list`,
  `map`, and `fn()`.

- Built-in HTML `<tag>` type, directly "borrowed" from the Imba
  programming language, with shorthand for common attributes (like
  `#id` and `.class`) and dynamic attribute values (like
  `data-name=wiki.name` or `.night-theme={is-night?}`).

- The `<tag>` type allows Hatter to work as an HTML templating
  system, either for static web sites or good ol' fashioned
  server-side rendering.

This manual covers the programming language part of Hatter. There is a
separate manual for the [Tag][tags] type, as well as a manual
containing all the built-in [Functions].

Please enjoy the journey.
